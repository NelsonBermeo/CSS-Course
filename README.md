# CSS-Course
This is the Learn CSS course from codecademy lets get it baby

didn't even get close to finishing during this break, guess ill work harder

Okay, so i finished. This was a nice little course to introduce the basics of css like colors, display, box models, typography nothing crazy but when i see some css i'll understand it better. There aren't much images of projects here because codecademy gives users something build upon, so if i put it here itd be like im showing off code that isnt mine
